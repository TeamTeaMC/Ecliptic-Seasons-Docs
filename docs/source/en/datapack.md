Supporting data packs is a fundamental part of Minecraft mod development, and Ecliptic Seasons are no exception.

You can also check for community support, such
as [Data packs for Ecliptic Seasons](https://github.com/joe-vettek/Datapacks-for-Ecliptic-Seasons).

This chapter introduces several tags and advancement systems related to Ecliptic Seasons.

## Biome Weather (Localized Weather)

Biome data support begins with setting up classification. For more advanced requirements, see the later sections (
reference only, not yet supported).

### Biome Classification

For **overworld agro biomes**, the following special tags are provided:
- `eclipticseasons:agro/warm` – applied to **warm regions**
- `eclipticseasons:agro/cold` – applied to **cold regions**
- `eclipticseasons:agro/hot` – applied to **hot regions**

For **biome and weather** tags, check the existing tags in the data folder:

- `eclipticseasons:rain/rainless` – Prevents rainfall in the biome.
- `eclipticseasons:rain/monsoonal` – Indicates that the biome has seasonal wet and dry periods.
- `eclipticseasons:rain/seasonal`, `eclipticseasons:rain/seasonal/hot`, `eclipticseasons:rain/seasonal/cold`, `eclipticseasons:rain/arid`, `eclipticseasons:rain/droughty`, `eclipticseasons:rain/soft`, and `eclipticseasons:rain/rainy` – Mainly provide minor adjustments to biome humidity calculations.
- If the `NotRainInDesert` option is enabled, biomes that do not receive rain in vanilla Minecraft will remain rainless regardless of these tags.
- `eclipticseasons:is_small` – A special tag used to mark small biomes and is generally not needed.

For **biome color** types, it's similar. And it's actually recommended to use resource packs to achieve more customized colors.
- `eclipticseasons:color/seasonal`, `eclipticseasons:color/seasonal/hot`, `eclipticseasons:color/seasonal/cold` — represent seasonal colors for normal, hot, and cold biomes respectively.
- `eclipticseasons:color/monsoonal` — represents colors for (tropical) monsoonal climate biomes.
- `eclipticseasons:color/stable`, `eclipticseasons:color/slightly` — represent areas with stable and slight color changes.

## Seasonal Crops and Humidity Conditions

This section is covered in more detail in the Agriculture chapter. By default, unregistered crops are not assigned any
control tags and behave as if tagged with both `eclipticseasons:crops/all_seasons` and
`eclipticseasons:crops/arid_humid`.

If the configuration `Crop.RegisterCropDefaultValue` is enabled, then all subclasses of `CropBlock` without tags will
default to having the seasons **Spring + Summer + Autumn** and humidity range **Moderate to Humid**.

### Season Types

Crop seasonal growth control now supports a richer set of data pack options, replacing the older simple configuration
system. However, you may still use the system described here if preferred.

By default, out-of-season crops may still grow at a reduced rate during adjacent or similar seasons. For example, crops
suited for summer and autumn may grow slowly in spring. However, they will not grow at all during winter.

| Type Name                                    | Supported Seasons        |

| `eclipticseasons:crops/summer`               | Summer                   |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/autumn`               | Autumn                   |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/winter`               | Winter                   |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/spring_summer`        | Spring + Summer          |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/spring_autumn`        | Spring + Autumn          |

| `eclipticseasons:crops/summer_winter`        | Summer + Winter          |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/autumn_winter`        | Autumn + Winter          |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/spring_summer_autumn` | Spring + Summer + Autumn |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/spring_summer_winter` | Spring + Summer + Winter |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/spring_autumn_winter` | Spring + Autumn + Winter |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/summer_autumn_winter` | Summer + Autumn + Winter |
| `eclipticseasons:crops/all_seasons`          | All seasons (year-round) |

### Humidity Types

There are only five humidity levels. By default, crops can grow slowly under humidity levels adjacent to their required
range.
However, if the difference is too great, growth will not occur at all.

## Advancement System

The advancement system of Ecliptic Seasons is largely based on Minecraft’s built-in setup, and is thus constrained by
data-driven
design. Modification typically requires overrides or support from modding mods.

This section refers to some special control parameters of Ecliptic Seasons. Upon completing seasonal progress, a *Core
Essence* item is rewarded.

If you don't want players to receive this item, you can override the loot tables under the `eclipticseasons:gifts`
directory or adjust the advancements accordingly.

Note that advancements of Ecliptic Seasons use a parent function to lock progression, namely `eclipticseasons:parent`.
